#  basiclly two type of loops :   1- for loop  2- while loop
# for loop-- for loop can iterate over a sequence of the iterable object in python. Iterating over a  sequence is nothing but iteating over strings, list, tuples, sets and dctionaries.

# name="Abhishek"
# for i in name:
#     print(i) 
#     if(i=="b"):
#         print("This is something spacial !")

# colors=["red","green","blue","yellow"]
# for color in colors:
#     print(color)
#     if(color=="green"):
#         print("this is spacial color here !")
#         for x in color:
#             print(x)


# using for loop with range()---

# for k in range(10):
#     print(k+1)

# for k in range(1,101):
#     print(k)

# for k in range(1,12,2): # output--->  1,3,5,7,9,11
#     print(k)
